📆 Countdown Timer
A simple JavaScript countdown timer that counts down to a specific date and displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds on the page.

🚀 Features
Real-time countdown to a specified date

Live update every second using setInterval()

Clean and minimal JavaScript – no libraries needed

Easy to customize for any event (e.g., launch, birthday, exam)

🧠 How It Works
The script uses JavaScript’s Date() object to get the current time and the target time.

It calculates the difference (in milliseconds), then converts it into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

Updates the HTML DOM every second to reflect the countdown.

🛠️ Customization
Change the target date in this line:

js
Copy
Edit
new Date("June 26, 2025 00:00:00")
You can style the countdown using CSS or integrate it into a larger web project.
